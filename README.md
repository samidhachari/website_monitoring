Troubleshooting

Common Issues

Screenshots not generating:
- Ensure Playwright is installed: `npx playwright install chromium`
- Check if websites block automated browsers
- Verify the `public/screenshots/` directory exists

SSL monitoring showing invalid:
- Some sites have strict SSL configurations
- Certificate info only works for HTTPS sites
- Firewall might block TLS connections

Supabase connection errors:
- Verify environment variables are correct
- Check if Supabase project is active
- Ensure database table exists

405 API errors:
- Make sure `route.ts` file is complete
- Restart development server
- Check if API route is properly exported

Development Commands
```bash
# Check for errors
npm run lint

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm run start

# Install missing dependencies
npm install
```

Performance & Optimization

- Sequential Processing: Screenshots are generated one by one to prevent system overload
- Smart Caching: Tailwind CSS optimized for production builds
- Error Boundaries: Comprehensive error handling prevents app crashes
- Responsive Images: Optimized screenshot display with Next.js Image component
